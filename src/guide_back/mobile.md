# Mobile

## Introduction

While Vue.js does not natively support mobile app development, there are a number of solutions for creating native iOS and Android apps with Vue.js.

## Hybrid-App Development

### Capacitor

[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) is a project from the [Ionic Team](https://ionic.io/) that allows developers to build native iOS, Android, and PWA apps with a single codebase by providing an API that can be run across multiple platforms.

### NativeScript

[NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org) powers cross-platform (truly native) mobile apps, using the web skills you already know. Combined they are a fantastic pair for developing immersive mobile experiences.
