# Standards

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops web accessibility standards for the different components:

- [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/)
  - web browsers and media players, including some aspects of assistive technologies
- [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/)
  - authoring tools
- [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
  - web content - used by developers, authoring tools, and accessibility evaluation tools

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

[WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) extends on [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and allows implementation of new technologies by addressing changes to the web. The W3C encourages use of the most current version of WCAG when developing or updating Web accessibility policies.

### WCAG 2.1 Four Main Guiding Principles (abbreviated as POUR):

- [Perceivable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#perceivable)
  - Users must be able to perceive the information being presented
- [Operable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#operable)
  - Interface forms, controls, and navigation are operable
- [Understandable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#understandable)
  - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable to all users
- [Robust](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#robust)
  - Users must be able to access the content as technologies advance

### Web Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)

W3C's WAI-ARIA provides guidance on how to build dynamic content and advanced user interface controls.

- [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/)
- [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/)
