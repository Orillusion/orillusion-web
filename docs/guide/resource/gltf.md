# GLTF
## What is glTF?
`glTF(GL Transmission Format)`  is a specification released by [khronos](https://www.khronos.org/gltf)  that enables efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes. It is a 'JPEG' format in the 3D field, covering traditional model formats such as' FBX 'and' OBJ '. It basically supports all features in 3D scenes, and its plugin mechanism also allows users to flexibly customize and implement the desired functions.
`GlTF 'is currently the preferred 3D scene transmission format recommended by' Orillusion ', and' Orillusion 'provides excellent support for the core functions and plugins of' glTF '.

## Load glTF
Using [Engine3D.res.loadGltf](/api/classes/Res#loadgltf) to load the 'gltf' model, this method optimizes the 'gltf/glb' file and allows for direct addition of objects:
```ts
let scene = new Scene3D();
// Load gltf file
let data = await Engine3D.res.loadGltf('sample.gltf');
// Add to scene
scene.addChild(data);
```

## Plugin support
Currently, the following `glTF` plugins are supported. If the `glTF` file contains the corresponding plugins, the corresponding functions will be automatically loaded:
| Plugins | Features |
| --- | --- |
| KHRdracomesh_compression | Support Draco compression, which can effectively save model volume |
| KHRlightspunctual | Supports multiple light source combinations, which will be resolved into engine light sources. Please refer to the [Lighting Tutorial](/guide/graphics/lighting) |
| KHRmaterialspbrSpecularGlossiness | Supports the 'PBR' highlight glossiness workflow |
| KHRmaterialsunlit | Supports  `Unlit` materials |
| KHRmaterialsvariants | Allow the renderer to have multiple materials and then switch materials through the `setMaterial` interface |
| KHRmeshquantization | Supports vertex data compression to save video memory. For example, vertex data is generally floating point numbers, which can be saved as an integer |
| KHRtexturetransform | Supports texture scaling displacement transformation |
| KHR_lights_punctual | Support for extended lighting, including `direction light` ，`point light` ， `spot light` |
