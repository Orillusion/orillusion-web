# Pick Event
In 3D applications, it is often necessary to click on objects in the scene. The engine supports ray box picking and frame buffer picking.

The supported pick events are:
| Name | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| PICK_OVER | Triggered once when the touch point enters the collision body range |
| PICK_OUT | Triggered once when the touch point leaves the collision body range |
| PICK_CLICK | Triggered once when the touch point is pressed and released in the collision body range |
| PICK_MOVE | Triggered when the touch point moves within the collision body range |
| PICK_UP | Triggered once when the touch point is released within the collision body range |
| PICK_DOWN | Triggered once when the touch point is pressed within the collision body range |

## Listening to Events
Picking events depend on the [Collider](/guide/physics/collider) component, and we can directly listen for `PointerEvent3D` events on the `Object3D` . The engine has unified two types of picking methods that can be switched through simple configuration.

```ts
//Pick and pick type need to be configured before the engine starts
Engine3D.setting.pick.enable = true;
// Bound: ray box picking, pixel: frame buffer picking
Engine3D.setting.pick.mode = `bound`; // or 'pixel'

await Engine3D.init()
// Picking detection depends on the Collider component
let obj = Object3D();
obj.addComponent(Collider);

// Add a PickEvent event listener to the node, where the corresponding event can be obtained in the callback function
obj.addEventListener(PointerEvent3D.PICK_CLICK, onPick, this);

// Or listen to all object click events through Engine3D.pickFire
Engine3D.pickFire.addEventListener(PointerEvent3D.PICK_CLICK, onPick, this);

//Get event information in the callback function
function onPick(e: PointerEvent3D) {
    ...
}
```

## Ray Box Picking
Ray box picking is a commonly used CPU-based picking method. It needs to calculate the intersection of the [Collider](/guide/physics/collider) component's `shape` and the mouse ray. It performs well in scenes with few objects, but has poor accuracy because the bounding box often cannot accurately represent the true shape of the object.   
> In order to maintain `cpu` performance, currently, ray box picking only supports active `pick` click picking and does not support `over/hover` state picking.

```ts
import {Object3D, Collider, BoxColliderShape, Vector3} from '@orillusion/core';

let box = new Object3D();
let mr = box.addComponent(MeshRenderer);
// Set the box geometry
mr.geometry = new BoxGeometry(1,1,1);
// Add collision box detection
let collider = box.addComponent(Collider);
// For the bound mode, the style and size of the collision box need to be set manually
// The picking accuracy depends on the match between box.geometry and collider.shape
collider.shape = new BoxColliderShape().setFromCenterAndSize(new Vector3(0, 0, 0), new Vector3(1, 1, 1));
```

- The `box` on the left uses `BoxColliderShape` with the same shape for detection, which has better accuracy.
- The `sphere` on the right also uses `BoxColliderShape`ï¼Œ, but the clickable area is larger than the actual model, resulting in lower accuracy.

## Frame Buffer Picking
Unlike the `pixel` mode and the `bound` mode, `Frame Buffer Picking` utilizes the pixel detection of the `GPU` , which consumes almost no `CPU` performance and can ignore the number and complexity of interactive objects in the scene, supporting all touch events. When the shape of the scene model is complex or there are a large number of objects, we recommend using the `pixel` mode for picking detection.
