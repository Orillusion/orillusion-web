# GodRay
`GodRay` is a visual effect of light passing through an object or cloud as one or more bright beams of light, usually in natural scenes where light passes through clouds, leaves, or otherwise
Because light is scattered or refracted by these objects, creating a visual glow effect,
```ts
// Init Engine
await Engine3D.init();

// Add a post-processing component
let postProcessing = this.scene.addComponent(PostProcessingComponent);

// Add GodRay
postProcessing.addPost(GodRayPost);

// Start render
let view = new View3D();
view.scene = this.scene;
view.camera = this.camera;
Engine3D.startRenderView(view);
```
